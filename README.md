# introduction

eletronix is ​​a quick starter system for software implementation in electron using next.js in a simplified way.

## install

to implement electronix in your system, clone this project and add it to your repository.

```bash
~# git clone https://github.com/victorratts13/eletronix.js.git
```

then, delete the flagged content inside ``main.js`` and insert your code.

```js
/*****init your code******/

/* 
  delete this part 
  of the code 
  and insert your 
  codes from that point.

*/

/*****end your code******/
```

## frontend


to do the frontend manipulation with next, it will be necessary to explore the ``renderer/`` where all Next.js components are found. 

>- WARNING: in order for your project to be successfully compiled, it is necessary to pay attention to the Next configuration file, inside the renderer folder:
``/renderer/next.config.js``

to build your application, run the ``npm run build`` command and after the process is finished, run ``npm start``
